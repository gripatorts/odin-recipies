    <p>Why buy the boxed stuff when you can make noodles at home?</p>
    <p>This homemade pasta recipe is way better than what you can buy at the store — and it’s surprisingly easy to throw together with just five ingredients you likely already have on hand!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, eggs, olive oil, and salt in a bowl until combined. Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time, to flour mixture until a smooth, thick dough forms.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes. Let dough rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 8 balls; use a pasta machine to roll and cut dough into desired pasta shape.</li>
    </ol>
